# Moive-Recommendation-

This work attempts at implementing a Data-Driven Recommendation Model on anime datasets. T
he datasets we are using in this work are representative sample of internet otaku community for demographics analysis and trends inside 
this group. It contains information about users (gender, location, birth date etc.), about anime (airing date, genres, producer) and 
anime lists that define how each user scores the anime.
